:::note Coming Soon

:::

## Overview

Settings are organized into categories:

## Configuration Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Authentication | Saved credentials for Kibana and other sources |
| Email | SMTP server configuration |
| Integrations | Third-party service connections |
| System | General system preferences |

## Authentication Profiles

Create reusable authentication profiles that can be referenced by multiple jobs. This avoids duplicating credentials and makes maintenance easier.
