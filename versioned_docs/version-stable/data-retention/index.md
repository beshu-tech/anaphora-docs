# Data Retention - Report History & Storage Management

Anaphora stores captured data and generated reports for reference and auditing purposes. This section covers how data is stored, managed, and retained.

## Overview

The Data Retention section provides access to:

- **Runs** - Execution history of your jobs, including successful captures, failures, and delivery status
- **Reports** - Generated report documents and templates

## Data Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Captures | Raw screenshots and extracted data |
| Reports | Generated report documents |
| Templates | Reusable report compositions |
| Variables | Extracted values from capture workflows |

## Retention Policies

Configure how long data is retained before automatic cleanup. This helps manage storage usage while maintaining necessary history.

## Next Steps

- [Runs](./data-retention/runs) - View execution history
- [Reports](./data-retention/reports) - Access generated reports
