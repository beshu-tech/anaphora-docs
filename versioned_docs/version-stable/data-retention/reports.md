# Reports

The Reports section provides access to all generated report documents and their delivery history.

## Overview

Reports are the final output of your capture jobs. A report is a PDF document assembled from captured screenshots,
extracted data, and formatted content.

## Viewing Reports

Access reports through:

- **Run history** - View report from specific execution
- **Report browser** - Browse all generated reports

## Report Storage

Most importantly, reports are delivered to configured destinations (email, Slack, S3, webhooks).
However, Anaphora also stores copies of generated reports for reference.
In the job configuration, you can set how long reports are retained.
