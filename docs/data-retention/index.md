# Data Retention - Report History & Storage Management

Anaphora stores captured data and generated reports for reference and auditing purposes. This section covers how data is
stored, managed, and automatically cleaned up.

## Overview

The Data Retention section provides access to:

- **Runs** - Execution history of your jobs, including successful captures, failures, and delivery status
- **Reports** - Generated report documents and archives

## Housekeeping & Automatic Cleanup

Anaphora includes automatic housekeeping to manage storage usage over time. You can configure retention policies for
runs and reports in the job settings.

## Next Steps

- [Runs](./data-retention/runs) - View execution history and job status
- [Reports](./data-retention/reports) - Access and manage generated reports
