## Overview

Every time a job executes, a **run** record is created. This allows you to:

- Track job execution history
- Identify and debug failures
- Review captured content
- Verify delivery success

## Run Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Success | Job completed and report delivered |
| Partial | Some actions succeeded, others failed |
| Failed | Job execution failed |
| Skipped | Conditions not met, no report sent |
