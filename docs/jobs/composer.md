# Composer - Report Builder

The Composer tab is where captured content becomes a professional report. Using a block-based editor, you can create
branded PDFs with custom layouts, text, images, and snapshots.

## Block Types

### Capture Blocks

| Block         | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Snapshots** | All captured screenshots                      |
| **Variables** | Captured texts, calculated values, AI results |

### Component Blocks

| Block       | Description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Text**    | Add any text to the report. Can contain variables. |
| **Image**   | Upload static images like logos                    |
| **Divider** | Horizontal line separator                          |
| **Spacer**  | Vertical whitespace                                |

## Layout

The report layout is built using a hierarchical structure of pages, rows, and cells.

| Structure | Description                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Page**  | Pages reflect PDF pagination. Every page consists of rows.    |
| **Row**   | Rows split pages horizontally into sections.                  |
| **Cell**  | Cells hold blocks within rows. Up to 3 cells can fit per row. |
