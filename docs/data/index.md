## Overview

Anaphora stores captured data and generated reports for reference and auditing purposes.

## Data Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Captures | Raw screenshots and extracted data |
| Reports | Generated report documents |
| Templates | Reusable report compositions |
| Variables | Extracted values from capture workflows |

## Data Retention

Configure how long data is retained before automatic cleanup. This helps manage storage usage while maintaining necessary history.
